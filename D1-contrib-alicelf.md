## Final test pass rate: 79% (42 passing, 11 failing, 0 skipped), final coverage rate: Line coverage: 64% 
I contributed the `addDataset ` and ` removeDataset `functions, as well as tests for each. I also helped to bug-fix and write/rewrite many of the functions in Liam's work on ` queryResponse `, and created a few tests for ` queryResponse `.

As I am one to commit very frequently, it slightly difficult to identify key commits where a large chunk of code is added.

* One key commit was when I completed ` addDataset `, found [here](https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/469f0605d8b38e257958dceeb49ff53795bfc23b).
* Another key commit was when I realized how to correctly compare 2 objects in a test, which led to the first ` queryResponse ` test working, as seen [here](https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/6d59a793f000a533b05c3034d7f16b4db953217c).

What went well this deliverable was adjusting to a new language was quite easy for me as TypeScript is similar in use to Java. What I think could go better (and we will improve upon for the next deliverable) is more clearly defining who should work on which/each part of the deliverable in order to each get started right away, rather than waiting for one person to take initiative as a pseudo "project lead".
