# Final Test Pass Rate: 55% (33 passing, 27 failing, 0 skipped) Coverage Rate: 83% Grade: 62%

Contributions: All of the REST API implementation.

Key commits:

1) Here I completed the REST functions after having a bit of an epiphany as to how they should work. My future commits then included tests for the functions. https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/71c409900b0a31502335bd456618ddf686df8bbd

2) Here is where significant progress was made on the REST API: https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/73cfe6bc7092e0b8a60cf62e24f520649fa69d49

What went well: As my partner did not contribute evenly on the previous deliverable, he agreed to make up for it by doing a large part of this deliverable's work, in performQuery.

What didn't go well: Partner had lots of issues with tests timing out on his portion so we are unable to get a very great grade.
