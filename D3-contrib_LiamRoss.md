Anything involving performQuery I did, and I had some major timeout issues AGAIN... I don't
    know what is going on with the server or why tests run on my computer and somehow timeout
    there consistently. Anyways, yeah I did all the stuff involving performQuery.


RETROSPECTIVE:

What went well:
    Wrote the code

What could be improved:
    timeout issues are garbage
