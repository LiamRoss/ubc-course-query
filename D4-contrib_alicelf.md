# Contribution

For this deliverable I created the scheduling algorithm, as well as implemented the first few methods for adding datasets to the server, and performing a simple query (via entering a JSON into a text box) on the added datasets.

# A few of my key commits are:

Fixing some major bugs in the scheduling system: https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/03620d36eb76b92e57efbc9036917f44cddd9189

Fixing a bug that allowed POST to work correctly: https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/bad5b218d820e82a5903b7c3411981f49a61d58d

Adding a numStudents property to be stored on disk (the pass+fail amount): https://github.com/CS310-2017Jan/cpsc310project_team46/commit/bad5b218d820e82a5903b7c3411981f49a61d58d

Among others, often spread out as I commit very frequently.

# What went well

Liam has experience working with and designing UI elements, so he was able to help out a lot with that stuff. Meanwhile I have recent experience with algorithms, so I took on the task of creating the scheduler algorithm. This split in the work was well handled.
